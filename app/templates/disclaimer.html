                warranties about its suitability or accuracy. Sometime in the
                future, someone will probably break some library or data source
                that this software is dependent on. If I become aware of the
                issue, I will, at my discretion attempt to fix it. The chances
                of a bug getting fixed are much more likely if you go to the
                Github page and create a pull request that I only have to merge.
